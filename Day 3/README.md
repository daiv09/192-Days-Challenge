# 📅 Day 3 — June 24, 2025

🔗 **Platforms**: Codeforces, LeetCode, InterviewBit  
📋 **Focus**: Segment Trees Deep Dive & Binary Search Variants  
💬 **Personal Note**: Today leaned more toward *quality of understanding* than quantity of problems. Due to internship work and a major presentation, I couldn’t solve much during the day — but I dove deeper into advanced concepts like segment trees and binary search tricks. I’m committed to grinding late tonight to keep the challenge alive 🔥

## 📘 Topics Explored

### 🧱 Segment Trees (Theory & Use Cases)
- Reviewed:
  - Segment Tree construction from scratch
  - Query/Update functions for range minimum, maximum, and sum
  - Time complexities: `Build - O(N)`, `Query/Update - O(log N)`
- Understood application in:
  - Competitive programming (range queries, dynamic arrays)
  - Real-time dashboards (e.g., Site24x7)
- Compared with Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Tree)

### 🔍 Binary Search Variations
- Concepts Studied:
  - Binary search on answers (search space reduction)
  - Rotated sorted arrays
  - Lower bound & upper bound tricks
  - Finding peak, first/last occurrence, and infinite bounds simulation

### 🧭 Reflections

- 🧠 **Today’s Learning**: Huge confidence boost in understanding Segment Trees.
- ⚠️ **Challenge Reminder**: Not every day has to be problem-heavy, but staying engaged daily is non-negotiable.
- 💯 **Discipline > Motivation** — and tonight’s session will keep that promise.

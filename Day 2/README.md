# 📅 Day 2 — June 23, 2025

🔗 **Platforms**: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), InterviewBit, CodeChef  
📋 **Sheet**: Mixed practice (CP31 + platform problems)  
💬 **Personal Note**: Explored Segment Trees deeply today — felt like unlocking a new level of power in DSA. Also set up Codefolio for centralized tracking, which makes managing progress a breeze. Mixed in math + time complexity problems for warmup and brain flex.

## 📘 Learnings & Reflections

- 📦 **Segment Trees**:
  - Understood use cases for **range queries**: sum, min, max.
  - Learned how to build, update, and query efficiently with O(log N) time.
  - Realized its power for real-time analytics & advanced problem solving.

- 🧑‍💻 **Setup & Tools**:
  - Integrated **Codefolio** with LeetCode, Codeforces, TUF, and more — helps visualize progress across sites.

- 📹 **Cloud Monitoring Course** (Kunal Khushwaha):
  - Learned client/server metrics, Site24x7 basics.
  - Useful for understanding backend infra — will help in startup vision too.

- 🚫 **Mistakes**:
  - "A - Race" failed due to misunderstanding edge behavior in loop-based simulation. Need to dry-run tricky loops more.

- 💡 **Win**:
  - Balanced problem solving with concept building.
  - Built future tools and understanding today that will pay off throughout the challenge!

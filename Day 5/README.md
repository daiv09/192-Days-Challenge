# 📅 Day 5 — June 26, 2025

🔗 **Platforms**: No solving today  
📋 **Focus**: Binary Search Deep Dive + Segment Tree Logic  
💬 **Personal Note**: No problems solved today — but it was far from unproductive. Between heavy internship workload and deep dives into concepts like Binary Search and Segment Trees, I still stayed in motion. **Labeled ~2000 images** as part of dataset preparation work — exhausting but rewarding.

## 📘 Topics Reviewed

### 🔍 Binary Search
- Recapped classic template + recursive flow
- Studied advanced variants:
  - Binary Search on 2D matrix (row/col mapping)
  - Binary Search on answers (min/max threshold problems)
  - Handling rotated arrays and duplicates

### 🧱 Segment Tree (Paper Practice)
- Reviewed build/query logic again
- Walked through multiple test cases on paper
- Began revisiting lazy propagation implementation

---

## 🧑‍💼 Internship Work

- 🔧 **Labeled ~2000 images** today for training a machine learning model
- Tasks included:
  - Annotation & bounding box labeling
  - Verifying class consistency
  - Organizing and cleaning data for model pipeline
- Insight: Real-world ML workflows are **data-heavy** before even touching models

## 🧠 Reflection

- 📚 Theory days matter — they reinforce the "why" behind the code
- ✅ Despite not solving problems, I *showed up*, learned, and contributed — streak is alive and strong
- Next: Make up with a problem-packed Day 6

### 🚀 Onward to Day 6!
> “Some days you build the model. Some days, you build the data. Both matter.”

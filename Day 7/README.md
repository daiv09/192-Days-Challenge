# 📅 Day 7 — June 29, 2025

🔗 **Platforms**: LeetCode, AtCoder, YouTube  
📋 **Focus**: Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Backtracking & Contest Practice  
💬 **Personal Note**: Today was a solid mix of **learning**, **implementing**, and **competing**. I finally dove deep into **Merge Sort**, got the intuition behind **Heap Sort**, and solved multiple **backtracking maze path** variations — each with increasing complexity. Closed the day by participating in **AtCoder Beginner Contest** and attending **AWS Gen-AI Session 3** — expanding both algorithmic and tech horizons.

## ✅ Key Activities

### 🧠 Concepts Learned
- **Merge Sort**:
  - Understood divide & conquer
  - Learned the merge logic, recurrence relation & time complexity (O(n log n))
- **Heap Sort**:
  - Gained idea of heapify and use of binary heap for sorting
  - Plan to revisit with implementation next

### 🔁 Backtracking Practice (Kunal Khushwaha - YouTube)
- Solved multiple variations of Maze problems:
  - ✅ Count total paths (single direction)
  - ✅ Print all paths (horizontal, vertical)
  - ✅ Diagonal paths
  - ✅ All 4-direction movement with visited marking (true backtracking intro)
- Key Takeaway: Recursive thinking needs patience — but super satisfying once visualized!

### 🔢 LeetCode Problem
- ✅ **Subsets of a Set** (Backtracking-based)
  - Explored recursion tree and used backtracking with base cases

## 🏁 AtCoder Beginner Contest

- Gave a full try at **AtCoder Beginner Contest**
  - Solved a few problems — tough, but learned how Japanese contests differ in logic structure
  - Will analyze and retry unsolved questions tomorrow

## 🌐 Event: AWS Gen-AI Session 3

- Attended **Session 3** of AWS Gen-AI Series in the morning
  - Topics: Responsible AI, prompt tuning, and Gen-AI applications in industry
  - Insight: Prompt engineering is shaping up to be a real skill

## 🧠 Reflections

- 💡 **Merge Sort finally makes sense!**
- 🧩 Backtracking is probably my favorite topic so far — logical, structured, and versatile
- 🎯 AtCoder humbled me a bit — time to increase contest confidence
- 🌍 Mixing learning with real-world AI knowledge keeps me energized and curious

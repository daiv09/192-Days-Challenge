# 📅 Day 1 — June 22, 2025

🔗 **Platform**: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)  
📋 **Sheet**: CP31 by TLE Eliminators  
💬 **Personal Note**: Kicked off strong! Solved most problems smoothly, though I made minor mistakes on a few — especially with edge cases and misunderstood problem intent once or twice. Good learning overall.

## 📘 Learnings & Reflections

- 🚫 **Mistakes**: A couple of initial Wrong Answers were due to overlooking edge cases or misinterpreting problem wording.  
- ✅ **Recovery**: Quick debugging helped me fix issues fast.  
- 🧠 **Improvement Areas**: 
  - Need to slow down on **first reads** — avoid rushing into implementation.
  - Strengthen understanding of **scoring mechanisms** (like in Target Practice).
- 💡 **Win**: Managed 11 problem attempts today — solid start for Day 1!

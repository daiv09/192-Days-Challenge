# 📅 Day 6 — June 27, 2025

🔗 **Platform**: Codeforces  
📋 **Focus**: Segment Trees, Cyclic Sort, and Intern Workload  
💬 **Personal Note**: Balanced the day between deep tech work and problem-solving efforts. I labeled **~2000 images** for my internship’s dataset — which took serious time and energy. Still made space to study Segment Trees again, revisit Cyclic Sort logic, and tried out a few Codeforces problems. Results weren’t perfect — but the discipline stayed on point.

## ✅ Problems Attempted

| #  | Problem | Verdict | Language | Time | Notes |
|----|---------|---------|----------|------|-------|

## 📘 Concepts Studied

### 🧱 Segment Trees
- Revised tree build & recursion
- Understood how to handle range queries using custom functions
- Simulated a few updates on paper to solidify indexing logic

### 🔁 Sorting — Cyclic Sort
- Reviewed the placement technique
- Key learning: mapping value to correct index position
- Understood applications: missing number, duplicate finding

## 🧑‍💼 Internship Task

- 🏷️ **~2000 images labeled** today
  - Annotation, verification, and cleanup for ML dataset
  - Mentally demanding — but useful for real-world pipeline exposure

---

## 🧠 Reflections

- Today was heavy on **execution**, even if not full of green ticks
- Lessons came from failures — especially in string comparisons & condition logic
- This challenge is as much about rhythm as it is about results
